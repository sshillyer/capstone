  "long_description": "You find yourself on a jagged sideway lined with cigarette butts and the occasional spit wad. Vehicles in all shapes from luxury tanks to duct tape disasters zip past, hovering at rates far exceeding those posted on any rational speedometer. Traffic lights offer multicolor suggestions, but few motorists seem to notice. At some point in the distant past, before the feds abandoned all hope of traffic law enforcement, a lines of steel guard rails were thrown up as a Hail Mary effort to keep oncoming traffic away from sweet old grannies shuffling their way to the neighborhood bodega. Breaches of this barrier are marked by twisted metal and a reddish tint to the accompanying sidewalk. A faint smell of hot dogs and hot dog farts permeates the smoggy air. This \"No Skateboarding\" sign is standing there a few feet away, just glaring at you and really pissing you off.",
