Flashes of light form binary patterns cycling through the sky, if you can call an amalgamation of circuitry and electrical currents a sky, collecting and redirecting stream of info from here to the horizon. You hear the clamor of a million kittens let loose on keyboards off towards your left- must be a chat room. To you right you see an alarming amount of digits sliding past towards a blackish data tower, but the view is obscured by a large wall of flames and- what was that? You could swear you just saw a jungle-sized spider skitter around one side of the flame wall. You look down to discover that you are now more like a radical ghost than a teen hacking sensation. Your body glows a bright blue and information seems to flow through you processing on a bionic level. You can feel the power. Woah.",
