Endless streams of industrial-strength inoculate poor from the ventilation, squelching out any bacterial growth and giving the lobby a stench best described as a dentist office built into a love motel. Long red banners hang from the ceiling to the floor, giving the room an odd octagonal shape and proudly displaying the \"EvilCorp Bank #404\" designation. Close to the entrance stands a shiny AutoBucksBot. A Security guard more mustache than face stand sentry nearby staging an amateur improve class worthy impression of someone who gives a damn. The red jumpsuit adorned with gleaming emblems proclaiming achievements like \"Most Beatings of the Month\" does nothing for that authorityâ€™s figure.",
