One encrypted file keeps flashing the same pattern in what must be some digital death cry.  Another sad data files spaghetti code flows out like guts dripping bits that scatter on the floor. In the center there is one exception, a gleaming Central Processing Unit- a disembodied giant head, kind of like a digital Olmec from Legends of the Hidden Temple glaring down all red eyed and angry at you.",
