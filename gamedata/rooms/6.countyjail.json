  "long_description" : "A loud \"CLANK\" hits your ears as your butt hits a slab of grey concrete.  It takes, like, a whole minute for your eyes to adjust to the budget lighting of your new surroundings. You immediately wish they hadnâ€™t wasted the cash on the single blinking bulb hanging directly from a wire in the center of the ceiling. You must be in some kind of waiting room to hell; off-white office equipment litters a couple of build-it-yourself desks and one squeaky office chairs overflows with a police officer typing with a single sausage-sized finger. Your gear has been confiscated and thrown on the unoccupied desk with complete lack of care. Across the bleak room is an even less appealing enclosure locked with steel bars and not much more than darkness inside. A metal door marks the entrance you must have been pushed in from and, incidentally, the only exit in sight.",
