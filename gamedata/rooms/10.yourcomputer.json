There's a glossy sticker on the front proclaiming \"Hack the System!\"  This mean machine is equipped with a floppy disk input port on the side. On the undercarriage is a thin panel screwed tightly shut to encapsulate the inner working of your beloved. The screen is smooth and clear except for a chipped section in the corner; the result of an intense game of pong. The key board displays all your favorite letters and some numbers too! Around the \"A\" you've used some white out and like, a bunch, of artistic skills to make a tiny anarchy symbol. <3 <3 <3!",
