The ceiling is tricked out with evenly spaced emergency sprinklers, there to protect the bastions of our nationâ€™s future should any of them catch fire, which just might be possible as there is a teacher surreptitiously smoking in a corner. Your locker, assigned at random, sports 3 marvelous examples of prose, \"Byte Me,\" \"Heaven is for Hackers- Always Save,\" and \"Nukem.\" On the opposite wall in a red and white fire alarm. There's a good chance a hall monitor could catch you skipping. Better move fast.",
